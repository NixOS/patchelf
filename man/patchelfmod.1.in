.SH NAME
PatchELFmod - Modify ELF files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B patchelfmod \fR[options] <elffile>

.SH DESCRIPTION
PatchELFmod is a simple utility to modify header data of ELF executables
and libraries. It can change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter")
of executables, change existing DT_SONAME entries of shared libraries
and manipulate the RPATH and DT_NEEDED entries of executables and libraries.

.SH OPTIONS
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage information.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display program version number.
.PP
Dynamic loader options:
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-set\-interpreter\fR <interpreter>
Change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter")
of an executable to <interpreter>.
.TP
\fB    \-\-interpreter\fR
An alias for '\-\-set\-interpreter'.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-print\-interpreter\fR
Print the ELF interpreter of an executable.
.PP
RPATH options:
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-set\-rpath\fR <rpath>
Change the RPATH of an executable or library to <rpath>.
.TP
\fB    \-\-rpath\fR <rpath>
An alias for '\-\-set\-rpath'.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-delete\-rpath\fR
Remove an existing RPATH.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-shrink\-rpath\fR
Remove all directories from RPATH that do not contain
a library referenced by DT_NEEDED fields of the executable
or library.
For instance, if an executable references one library
libfoo.so, and has an RPATH "/lib:/usr/lib:/foo/lib",
and libfoo.so can only be found in \fI/foo/lib\fP, then the
new RPATH will be "/foo/lib".
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-print\-rpath\fR
Print the RPATH of an executable or library.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-print\-rpath\-type\fR
Print the type of the RPATH, whether it's DT_RPATH
or DT_RUNPATH.
.TP
\fB    \-\-rpath\-type\fR
An alias for '\-\-print\-rpath\-type'.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\-rpath\fR
Force the use of the obsolete DT_RPATH instead of
DT_RUNPATH.
By default DT_RPATH is converted to DT_RUNPATH.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-convert\-rpath\fR
Convert an existing DT_RPATH to DT_RUNPATH.
.PP
DT_NEEDED options:
.TP
These options can be given multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-add\-needed\fR <library>[,<library>...]
Add a dependency <library> on a dynamic library.
Can be a single library or a comma seperated list.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-remove\-needed\fR <library>[,<library>...]
Remove a dependency <library> from a dynamic library.
Can be a single library or a comma seperated list.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-replace\-needed\fR <library>,<new\-library>
Replace a dependency <library> on a dynamic library with
a new dependency <new\-library>.
Arguments must be separated by comma.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-print\-needed\fR
Prints all DT_NEEDED entries.
.PP
DT_SONAME options:
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-set\-soname\fR <soname>
Change the DT_SONAME entry of a library to <soname>.
.TP
\fB    \-\-soname\fR <soname>
An alias for '\-\-replace\-soname'.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-print\-soname\fR
Print the soname of a library.
.PP
Other options:
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-backup\fR
Save a backup of the unmodified file with the
suffix '~orig'.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Print details of the changes made to the input file.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-full\-debug\fR
Same as '\-\-debug', but including information about
rewriting symbols, which can be quite a lot.
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-print\-all\fR
Runs all print options at once. This equals '\-FIptPN'.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-with\-gold\-support\fR
Support executables created by the Gold linker.
.IP
These are marked as ET_DYN (not ET_EXEC) and have a
starting virtual address of 0 so they cannot grow
downwards. In order not to run into a Linux kernel bug,
the virtual address and the offset of the new PT_LOAD
segment have to be equal; otherwise ld\-linux segfaults.
To ensure this, it may be necessary to add some padding
to the executable (potentially a lot of padding, if
the executable has a large uninitialised data segment).

.SH BUGS
Deleting and adding a new RPATH again and again will make the file
grow a few KiB each time. This also happens if the RPATH was deleted
with \fBchrpath\fR(1).
.PP
The \fBstrip\fR(1) command from binutils generates broken executables when
applied to the output of patchelf (if '\-\-set-rpath' or '\-\-set-interpreter'
with a larger path than the original is used).
This appears to be a bug in binutils.
