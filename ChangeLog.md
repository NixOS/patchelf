# Release History

## 0.15.4 (August 12, 2025)

* Update to a later glibc `elf.h`.

  This should not result in any behavioral changes, except for possibly better architecture-specific support.

## 0.15.3 (August 12, 2025)

This is a backport release made from the simplest fixes from 0.16.0.

* Handle `glibc-hwcaps` on `ppc64le` on CentOS/RHEL/Rocky 8 for `tests/replace-add-needed.sh` (fixes #406) by @robert-scheck in https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/pull/407
* Fix Out-of-bounds read in the function `modifyRPath` by @xiaoxiaoafeifei in https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/pull/419
* Fix out of bounds access when increasing program header table by @Bo98 in https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/pull/411

## 0.15.2 (August 12, 2025)

* In the autotools build system for the tests, pass a few more tool env vars in `TESTS_ENVIRONMENT`.

  Some of them are not used yet (at all, or at least not in this backport to the `0.15-maintenance` branch), but at least `STRIP` is.

## 0.15.1 (August 12, 2025)

The objective is to prepare a very conservative patch release which can be bumped in Nixpkgs immediately.

* Backport infra changes from later master (August 2025)
* Backport shellcheck fixes to test suite
* Backport C++ code quality fixes (all of https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/pull/464 but the final two commits)

The behavior of this version should be essentially the same as 0.15.0.

  gdb to show proper backtraces.

* Added `--remove-needed' option.

## 0.6 (November 7, 2011)

## 0.4 (June 4, 2008)

* Support for growing the RPATH on dynamic libraries.

* IA-64 support (not tested) and related 64-bit fixes.

  `DT_RUNPATH` over `DT_RPATH`, which is obsolete.  When updating, if both
  are present, both are updated.  If only `DT_RPATH` is present, it is
  converted to `DT_RUNPATH` unless `--force-rpath' is specified.  If
  neither is present, a `DT_RUNPATH` is added unless `--force-rpath' is
  specified, in which case a `DT_RPATH` is added.

## 0.3 (May 24, 2007)

* Support for 64-bit ELF binaries (such as on x86_64-linux).

* Support for big-endian ELF binaries (such as on powerpc-linux).

* Provides a hack to get certain programs (such as the
  Belastingaangifte 2005) to work.

## 0.1 (October 11, 2005)

* Initial release.
