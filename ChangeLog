  --add-needed & --replace-needed (contributed by rgcjonas),
  --add-needed-list, --remove-needed-list,
  --set-soname, --print-soname
* Add short aliases for each option (-h, -I, -a, -S, ...)
* Add tests for new options.

* Rewrite section indices in symbol tables. This for instance allows
  gdb to show proper backtraces.
* Added '--remove-needed' option.

0.6 (November 7, 2011):
* Hacky support for executables created by the Gold linker.
* Support segments with an alignment of 0 (contributed by Zack
  Weinberg).

* Various bugfixes.
* '--force-rpath' now deletes the DT_RUNPATH if it is present.

0.4 (June 4, 2008):
* Support for growing the RPATH on dynamic libraries.
* IA-64 support (not tested) and related 64-bit fixes.
* FreeBSD support.
* '--set-rpath', '--shrink-rpath' and '--print-rpath' now prefer
  DT_RUNPATH over DT_RPATH, which is obsolete.  When updating, if both
  are present, both are updated.  If only DT_RPATH is present, it is
  converted to DT_RUNPATH unless '--force-rpath' is specified.  If
  neither is present, a DT_RUNPATH is added unless '--force-rpath' is
  specified, in which case a DT_RPATH is added.

0.3 (May 24, 2007):
* Support for 64-bit ELF binaries (such as on x86_64-linux).
